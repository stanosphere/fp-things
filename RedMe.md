# FP Things

This repo is going to be quite messy for now. It's basically just me playing around with functional programming things in JavaScript. I think a lot of this might just end up as me taking notes about things and also implementing some lovely functional stuff of my own. The main resources I've been using are:

- Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming
  - https://github.com/MostlyAdequate/mostly-adequate-guide 
  - This is a great book
  - It starts out by explaining how we can write programs using nothing more than functions and compositions
  - And eventually gets into the mysterious land of *Algebraic Data Types* 
  - It draws a lot of inspiration in the latter chapters from https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land

- Fantasy Land
  - https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-land
  - This is a specification for all the usual Algebraic Data Types in JavaScript

- Fantas, Eel, and Specification blog by Tom Harding
  - http://www.tomharding.me/2017/03/03/fantas-eel-and-specification/
  - This is actually amazing
  - Kind of gives an overview of all these wonderful things from scratch
  - Seems to go through the *Fantasy Land Spec* and try to explain it to normal people like me

- Project Awesome 
 - https://project-awesome.org/stoeffel/awesome-fp-js
 - A rather eclectic list of fp resources that I have found useful :) 

## To Do (3/3/19)

- Convert my logs into proper tests
  - I'm looking at you PaulSet file!
  - I might be able to use that jsverify thing that I've seen lying around
- Perhaps add tests for some of my other things
- Finish off work on PaulSet and the Setoid type in general
- Move on to the next thing in Tom's blog: Ords!
